## AiCore Module No.3 - Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors


In my AiCore Bootcamp course, I had to create a "Rock - Paper - Scissors" game that was based on [Deep Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning#:~:text=Deep%20learning%20is%20a%20subset%20of%20machine%20learning%20that%27s%20based%20on%20artificial%20neural%20networks.%20The%20learning%20process%20is%20deep%20because%20the%20structure%20of%20artificial%20neural%20networks%20consists%20of%20multiple%20input%2C%20output%2C%20and%20hidden%20layers.).

For those not familiar with "Rock - Paper - Scissors" you can find a general explanation of the classic hand game [here](https://github.com/Josh-BI-UK/AiCore-Computer-Vision/blob/main/Game-Rules.md).

### Learning Objective:
Using a webcam streaming video image, build a deep learning model that recognizes a player's gestures (e.g. either Rock, Paper, Scissors) and correctly analyses them.

### End Goal: 
Create a Python-based "Rock, Paper Scissors" game against the computer using the above logic.
