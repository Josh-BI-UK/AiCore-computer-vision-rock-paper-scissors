# How to Play 'Rock Paper Scissors'

"Rock, paper, scissors" is one of the most beloved games of all time originating in China [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). The game is usually played between two people using only their hands. 

During the game, players will deliver hand signals representing the elements of the game i.e . rock, paper, or scissors.

During each round, players say, “rock, paper, scissors, go!”, On “go,” (or another starting phase e.g. shoot!) each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for the paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. 

_The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:_

- Rock wins against scissors.
- Scissors win against the paper.
- Paper wins against the rock.
